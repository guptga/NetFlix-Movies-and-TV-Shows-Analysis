# Project_1
This data comes from Kaggle . 
 This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2020. This dataset shows that over the years content on netflix increases. 
 As we can see in bar plot visualization of dataset there is almost 3 times more content added on netflix in 2017 as compare to 2016.
 Also, it is clear from the bar plots and pie plots that there are more movies avaliable on netflix than tv shows.
 One more conclusion we can make based on genre is that people like to watch more documentaries on netflix as this was the most watched genre.
